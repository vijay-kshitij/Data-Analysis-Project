This is a case study about a fictional restaurant, Benâ€™s Pizzeria, aimed at exploring key aspects of the restaurant business such as understanding customer preferences, efficient inventory management, and optimizing staff resources. The analysis uncovers insights to support data-driven strategies and enhance decision-making.

This project leverages SQL, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud MySQL Instance, and Looker Studio to perform data analysis and visualization. **SQL** was utilized for custom queries, data manipulation, and analysis tasks. Data was stored in a **Google Cloud MySQL Instance**, which was linked to a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket for seamless data ingestion. **Looker Studio** was then connected to the MySQL Instance to create dynamic and interactive visualizations, enabling insightful data representation and reporting.
